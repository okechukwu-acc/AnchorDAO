# AnchorDAO

## Overview

**AnchorDAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) management tool built purely with Rust and the Anchor framework on the Solana blockchain. It provides a secure, transparent, and efficient way to create, manage, and participate in DAOs.

## Features

- **DAO Creation**: Easily create new DAOs with customizable parameters.
- **Proposal System**: Submit, discuss, and vote on proposals within the DAO.
- **Token-Based Voting**: Implement token-weighted voting to ensure fair decision-making.
- **Governance Tokens**: Issue and manage governance tokens for DAO members.
- **Treasury Management**: Securely manage DAO funds with multi-signature wallets.
- **Activity Logs**: Keep a transparent record of all DAO activities and decisions.

## Architecture

AnchorDAO is built using the following components:

- **Solana Blockchain**: A high-performance blockchain ensuring fast and secure transactions.
- **Anchor Framework**: A framework for building secure and scalable smart contracts on Solana using Rust.
- **Rust**: A systems programming language focused on safety and performance.

## Installation

To set up AnchorDAO, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Rust: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Solana CLI: [Install Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- Anchor CLI: [Install Anchor CLI](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html)

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AnchorDAO.git
cd AnchorDAO
```

### Build the Project

```sh
anchor build
```

### Deploy the Smart Contracts

Update the `Anchor.toml` and `deploy/config.json` files with your configuration. Then, run:

```sh
anchor deploy
```

## Usage

### Creating a DAO

To create a new DAO, interact with the deployed smart contract using the Solana CLI or any Solana-compatible wallet that supports smart contract interactions. Provide the necessary parameters such as DAO name, governance token details, and initial treasury funds.

### Submitting Proposals

DAO members can submit proposals using the `submit_proposal` function. Proposals can include actions like fund allocations, parameter changes, or any other DAO-related decisions.

### Voting on Proposals

Members vote on proposals using their governance tokens. The voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held. The proposal is executed if it receives the required number of votes within the specified timeframe.

### Managing Treasury

DAO funds are managed through multi-signature wallets. Transactions require approval from a predefined number of DAO members, ensuring secure fund management.
